# Averos Documentation

<br/>

This is the official Averos Documentation Placeholder.
Content will be updated by the official documentation as things progress.

This was forked, then detached from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE/).
We would like to thank [Michael Rose](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) for his amazing work bringing this Jekyll theme to life.

Also a big thank you to [Katerina Limpitsouni]("https://twitter.com/ninaLimpi" "Katerina Limpitsouni") for her amazing and creative work available on her site ["undraw.co"]("https://undraw.co/" "undraw.co"), from which some of the illustrations on this site are taken. Please support her.
