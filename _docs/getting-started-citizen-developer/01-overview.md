Welcome to averos getting started tutorial! <br/>

This tutorial is exclusively dedicated to developers and will walk you through basics steps of creating a web application using averos framework. <br/>
It is assumed that you have basic software development knowledge including **`UML design`**, **`typescript`** or **`JavaScript`**, **`json`**, **`angular`** and **`reactive programming`**. <br/>

In this tutorial you will be taken through key steps of creating a basic web application named **`ToDoApplication`** where you will build a `ToDo tracking application` that stores and manages **`Tasks`** you need to achieve into seperate **`Domains`**. <br/>
By the end of this tutorial you will aqcuire solid knowledge about how **`averos framework`** is used in order to rapidly create applications and will be able to leverage all `averos` features and capabilities to barge your way into the creation of cutting edge web applications in no time. <br/>

üö© Please note that **`averos framework`** is fully described in the  [**Documentation**]({{"/averos/documentation/" | relative_url}} "Reference") section.

## **I. Overview**

Before starting the creation of our application let have a high level technical view regarding how `averos` is used in conjunction with `angular` in building web applications. <br/> 
Creating an angular based web application with averos is only 3 steps away:

- [x] **Create** a regular angular application
- [x] **Add** **Averos** framework
- [x] **Build**, package and run your application

On the other hand, customizing your application by adding your entities and their related business use cases will require further design steps. Those design steps are tightly coupled to the user requirements and application specifications. Those additional steps are:
- [x] **Design** your entities, interactions and use cases
- [x] **Integrate** your design within averos. A set of prebuilt use cases could be generated with the help of averos use case command line workflow (further details below).
- [x] **Customize** your application by adding specific business requirements and rules.
