**Welcome to averos getting started tutorial for citizen developers !** <br/>

This tutorial is exclusively dedicated to **citizen developers** and will walk you through basics steps of creating a web application using **`averos designer`**. <br/>
It is assumed that you have basic [**Unified Modeling Language (UML)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language "Unified Modeling Language (UML)") design knowledge so that you understand the design that you are going to make.<br/>
Nevertheless, if you have not any knowledge of [**UML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language "Unified Modeling Language (UML)"), you still can create your application if you carefully follow all the details in this tutorial. <br/>

In this tutorial you will be taken through key steps of creating a basic web application named **`ToDoApplication`** where you will build a `ToDo tracking application` that stores and manages **`Tasks`** you need to achieve into seperate **`Domains`**. <br/>

By the end of this tutorial you will aqcuire solid knowledge about how **`averos designer`** is used in order to rapidly create applications and will be able to leverage all **`averos framework`** features and capabilities to barge your way, as a citizen developer, into the creation of cutting edge web applications in no time. <br/>

üîñ Please note that **`averos framework`** is fully described in the  [**Documentation**]({{"/averos/documentation/" | relative_url}} "Reference") section.

## **I. Overview**

Before starting the creation of our application let us have a high level view regarding how `averos designer` is used in building web applications. <br/> 
Creating a web application with `averos designer` is only 3 steps away:

1. **Design** 
2. **Validate**
3. **Generate**

You will be able to execute all these steps without having any technical knowledge whatsoever.<br/>

Still, you will need to **configure** and **deploy** your application so that you'll be able to see what it looks like.<br/>
These two additional steps, usually requires technical knowledge. <br/>
Don't worry however, for the sake of this tutorial, you are going to configure, deploy and run your application without having the need to have any technical background.<br/>
More on this later.

So, how about we start our journey ?<br/>

Let's go!
