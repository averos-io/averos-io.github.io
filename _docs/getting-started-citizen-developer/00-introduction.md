        This tutorial is intended to help non developers get initiated to averos framework throughout a step by step guide into creating an averos application using averos designer.<br/>
        It is recommended that you have a minimum amount of knowledge on Unified Modeling Language (UML) design.<br/>
        However, you'll still be able to follow this tutorial- thought it will be a little bit harder for you- 
        if you haven't any knowledge on Unified Modeling Language. <br/>
