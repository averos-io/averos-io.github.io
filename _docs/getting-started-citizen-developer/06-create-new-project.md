 >ðŸš©As mentioned in the previous section, **Averos Designer** is available anonymously for the whole public.<br/>
However, submitting an application generation request will requires you to be signed into your account space.<br/>
 So please make sure you have created a **new** **WiBuild** **account** and **validate** it before starting to create your application so that you would be able to submit an application generation request.<br/>
 Also, since the validation process is initiated by email, make sure you provide a real email address so that you would be able to receive the validation link.<br/><br/>
 **Now let go ahead and start designing!**

## **I. Create a New Project**   

### **Step 1 - Navigate to WiBuild** 
-------
Navigate to [**WiBuild**](https://appbuilder.wiforge.com/ "WiBuild") and **sign into** your  account using a **valid** user 

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">

      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/5-wibuild-user-private-space.png" alt="WiBuild - User Private Space">
        <figcaption>WiBuild - User Private Space</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

Note that **four** main things have been pointed out in the picture above, namely:
  >1. **Number One/1** : this is the menu to the **application management module** where you will be able to **search** and **download** your **application binary files** as well as their related **averos designer projects**
  2. **Number Two/2** : this is your private dashboard. It gives you the following informations:
  >- Your daily generation requests limit: **WiBuild** allows only 10 daily generation requests per user 
  >- Your current tolerated number of application generation requests in the current day
  >- The number of application build you created in the current day
  >- The number of ongoing application generation processes you created in the current day
  >- The number of generated application in the current day
  >- The number of failed application generation in the current day
>
 > 3. **Number Three/3** : this button is the link to **Averos Designer** (this is how you open **averos designer**)
 > 4. **Number Four/4**  : shows the supported languages. You might switch to your favorite language using this menu link
<br/>


### **Step 2 - Open Averos Designer** 
--------
Now,  Go ahead and open **averos designer** using the button you have seen earlier (Number 3 in the previous picture)<br/>

Here is what **averos designer** looks like:

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/6-averos-designer-home.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/6-averos-designer-home.png" alt="Averos Designer">
        <figcaption>Averos Designer</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

Note that **three** things have been pointed out in the picture above, namely:
  >1. **Number One/1**   : this is the link to **create a new project**
  2. **Number Two/2**   : this is the link to **import an existing project**
  3. **Number Three/3** : this is the link to **get back to WiBuild Home screen**


### **Step 3 - Create New Project** 
-------------
Create a new averos project using the dedicated menu link (Number 1)<br/>

Here is what your designer should look like:

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/7-averos-designer-new-project.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/7-averos-designer-new-project.png" alt="Averos Designer - New Project">
        <figcaption>Averos Designer - New Project</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

Go ahead and close the welcome message.<br/>

Let's examine our **Averos Designer Workspace**:

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/8-averos-designer-new-project-workspace.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/8-averos-designer-new-project-workspace.png" alt="Averos Designer - Workspace">
        <figcaption>Averos Designer - Workspace</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

As pointed out in the picture aboce, our **Averos Designer Workspace** is composed of three parts:
>1. **Number 1 :** This is the **Averos Components** panel where you will find most of the component you will drag&drop in the canvas
2. **Number 2 :** This is the **top menu** and is composed of the following menu items (icons **from Left to Right**):
>-  **Home** : gets you back to **WiBuild** home page
>-  **Language** : switch the language
>-  **Switch light/dark Mode** : switch between **light** and **dark** modes
>-  **Import** : import an averos project as a `json` file
>-  **New** : create a new projects
>-  **Fullscreen ON/OFF** : switch fullscrenn On or Off
>-  **Toggle canvas grid** : Toggle the Canvas Grid On or Off
>-  **reset scale** : rest the canvas scale to default scale
>-  **validate project** : Validate an averos project. Once the project validation succeeded this button will be replaced by two other buttons, namely:
>   - **Export Application** : Export an application to a `json` file
>   - **Generate my application** : submit an application generation request

>3. **Number 3 :** This is the **Averos Components** panel where you will find most of the component you will drag&drop in the canvas
>4. **Number 4 :** This is your workspaces' Canvas, where will be dragged & dropped all your components. Your design will be made in this area.

### **Step 4 - Project Properties**  
-------------

Now, let's configure our project properties. Those properties are related to your application general features.<br/>

Go ahead and click on an empty space in the canvas.<br/>
**`Project Properties`** will show up in the right panel.<br/>

Set the following parameters as follows:
>-  **`Application Name`** : `ToDoApplication`
- **`Description`**: describe your application (example: `A simple ToDo application that serves as an example in averos framework tutorial for citizen developers`)
- leave the default values for the remaining configuration parameters

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/9-project-properties.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/9-project-properties.png" alt="Project Properties">
        <figcaption>Project Properties</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

>**Congratulations!** You have now created an empty **averos application** named **`ToDoApplication`**.<br/>
Your application is by default:<br/>
  >- multiusers
  >- multi-language ready
  >- progressive
  >- responsive
  >- supports authentication
  >- has light and dark modes 
  >- has a default login / register / profile pages
  <br/>
>
After we created and configured our **ToDoApplication**, it is high time we start to implement our business entities along with our business requirements.<br/>
<br/>
In the next section, we are going to design our entities along with their managing services.<br/>
**See you there!**
