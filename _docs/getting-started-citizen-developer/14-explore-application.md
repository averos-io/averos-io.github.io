## **I. Introduction**

Congratulations! Your application is now ready to be explored.<br/>
Remember, once you get used to the whole process, developing such an applications becomes next to nothing.<br/>

Now, let's look at what you have created in details!<br/>

Since your application supports two context modes, namely `public mode` and `private mode` we will organize this trip according to these two context modes.<br/>

Let's start examining the `public mode`.<br/>

🙋‍♂️Since i prefer `dark mod`e, all my print screens will be in that mode, but you are free to carry on with the `light mode` if you wish to.<br/>

## **II. Public Context**

As we mentioned in this tutorial, `public context` is the application context where  anonymous unauthenticated users could use the application features.<br/>
lets see what is already available in this mode.<br/>

### **1. Default Sign In and Sign Up Pages**

These default pages are availables publicly.<br/>
here is what they look like:<br/>

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/70-todoapplication-signup.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/70-todoapplication-signup.png" alt="ToDoApplication - Sign Up">
        <figcaption>ToDoApplication - Sign Up</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>

<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/71-todoapplication-signin.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/71-todoapplication-signin.png" alt="ToDoApplication - Sign In">
        <figcaption>ToDoApplication - Sign In</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

Later in this section, we are going to use these both pages to `register` a new user and to `sign into` his account in the `private context`.<br/>

### **2. My Public Page**

Remember, in the requirement phase, one of our requirements was to create a `public blank page`.<br/> 
This page should be accessible publicly via a link to the default application top menu.<br/>

Here is what our public page along with its menu entry look like:

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/72-todoapplication-public-blank-page.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/72-todoapplication-public-blank-page.png" alt="ToDoApplication - Public Blank Page">
        <figcaption>ToDoApplication - Public Blank Page</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

Note that your application support `English` and a second language as well (`French` in my case).

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/73-todoapplication-French.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/73-todoapplication-French.png" alt="ToDoApplication - French Supported">
        <figcaption>ToDoApplication - French Supported</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

## **II. Private Context**

Now let's register a new user so that we could sign into an account in the private context.<br/>

Go ahead and click on `Sign Up` then create a new user as follows:
