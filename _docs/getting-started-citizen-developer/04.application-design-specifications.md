## **I. Introduction**

So far, we have defined our application purpose and described its bsuiness requirements.<br/>
As a result, the main business entities are starting to emmerge as we delve deeper and deeper into definitions and requirements. <br/>

Now it's time to define our application design.<br/>

In this section we will use two **UML diagrams**, namely, **class diagram** and **use case diagram**.<br/>

**Class diagram** is a specific representation of entities, their attributes and their relationships.<br/>

On the other hand, **Use Case Diagram** is a specific representation of a users's possible interactions with the application. It depicts what a user can do with the application.<br/>

Don't worry if this doesn't sound familiar to you, you'll easily get into it as we move forward.<br/>


## **II. ToDo Application Design**

If you carefully examine the Application definitions and business requirements, you will find out that those could be depicted by some entities and components. <br/>
Here are the main components that you might think of:
  - Two main entities, **ToDoArea** and **ToDoTask** (we are starting to give our entities significant names)
  - Four main use cases for each entity (i.e. `create/delete/search/update`) (a user might interact with the application in four different ways for each entity)
    - **(create/delete/search/update) ToDoArea**
    - **(create/delete/search/update) ToDoTask**
  - Two use cases that involve both **ToDoArea** and **ToDoTask** (i.e. `assign/unassign`) and which is dealing with update entity relationships: (a user might interact with the application in two different ways when dealing with both of entities)
    - **(assign/unassign)** **ToDoTask**(s) from a given **ToDoArea**


### **II.1- `ToDoApplication` Class Diagram**

According to our previous study, it is safe to assume that the following class diagram could genuinely describe our main entities and their relationships. 

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;">
<figure align="center">

      <figcaption>ToDoApplication UML Diagram</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>
</div>

Let's explain what is happening here.<br/>

This class diagram describes **`ToDoArea`** entity and **`ToDoTask`** as follows:

  1. **an entity named `ToDoArea`** defines an **Area** and has the following seven attributes names or characteristics:
  >*  `id`  : defines the entity's identifier. Is of type `number`
  >*  `name`: defines the entity's name. Is of type `text`
  >*  `description`: defines the entity's description. Is of type `text`
  >*  `createdBy`  : defines who created the entity. Is of type `User`
  >*  `updatedBy`  : defines who updated the entity. Is of type `User`
  >*  `createdAt`  : defines when the entity was created. Is of type `date`
  >*  `updatedAt`  : defines when the entity was updated. Is of type `date`
  >*  a relationship with **`ToDoTask`** entity: depicted by the fact that **zero or one** `(0..1)` **`ToDoArea`** contains **zero or many** `(0..*)` **`ToDoTask`**
    
2. **an entity named `ToDoTask`** defines a **Task** and has the following seven attributes names or characteristics:
  >*  `id`  : defines the entity's identifier. Is of type `number`
  >*  `name`: defines the entity's name. Is of type text
  >*  `description`: defines the entity's description. Is of type `text`
  >*  `createdBy`  : defines who created the entity. Is of type `User`
  >*  `updatedBy`  : defines who updated the entity. Is of type `User`
  >*  `createdAt`  : defines when the entity was created. Is of type `date`
  >*  `updatedAt`  : defines when the entity was updated. Is of type `date`
  >*  `status`     : defines the **status** of the task. It could be one of these fixed values: **`Active`**, **`Closed`** or **`New`** (A task can be **new**, **active** or **closed**. We could have thought about other statuses; but we wanted to keep it as much simple as possible for this tutorial). Since this attribute has a set of predefined values it is of type `enumeration`

  3. **Two services for each entity**, **`ToDoAreaService`** and **`ToDoTaskService`**.
  > These are the services that manage each entity.<br/>
  > Please keep in mind that you don't have to know the methods implemented by these services.
  > All what you should know is that:
  >-   there are one managing service for each entity as follows:
  >-  **`ToDoAreaService`** managing the entity **`ToDoArea`**
  >-  **`ToDoTaskService`** managing the entity **`ToDoTask`**
  >-  these services are responsible for communicating with the **backend service** (`backend service mock` in our case)

### **II.2- `ToDoApplication` Use Cases Diagram**

According to our previous study we have identified a couple of use cases that define how a given user can interact with our `ToDoApplication`. <br/>
Those use cases might be described by the following Use case diagram.

<br/>

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;">
<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/arch/tutorial/to-do-area- use-case-diagram.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/arch/tutorial/to-do-area- use-case-diagram.png" alt="ToDoArea Use Case Diagram">
      <figcaption>ToDoArea Use Case Diagram</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>
</div>

<br/>

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;">
<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/arch/tutorial/to-do-task-use-case-diagram.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/arch/tutorial/to-do-task-use-case-diagram.png" alt="ToDoTask Use Case Diagram">
      <figcaption>ToDoTask Use Case Diagram</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>
</div>

Again, few things are happening here.<br/>

The first use case diagram describes how a user interacts with **`ToDoArea`** entity using our application:
>-  a user can **`View`**/**`delete`**/**`add`**/**`update`** a **`ToDoArea`** instance
>- a user can **`Assign`**/**`Unassign`** a **`ToDoTask`** to a **`ToDoArea`**   
>-  a user can **`Search`** for **`ToDoArea`** instances
>- All these actions are performed while the user is signed into the application (user is in the private context).
>- some actions includes a search for **`ToDoArea`** (**`View`**, **`add`** and **`update`** a **`ToDoArea`** are possible after executing a search action)


The second use case diagram describes how a user interacts with **`ToDoTask`** entity using our application:
>- a user can **`View`**/**`delete`**/**`add`**/**`update`** a **`ToDoTask`** instance
>- a user can **`Close`** a **`ToDoTask`** instance   
>- a user can **`Search`** for **`ToDoTask`** instances
>- All these actions are performed while the user is signed into the application (user is in the private context).
>- All these actions includes a search for **`ToDoTask`** (**`View`**, **`add`** and **`update`** a **`ToDoTask`** are possible after executing a search action)

>‚ÑπÔ∏è Believe it or not, you have done half the work of building your application. Congratulations !<br/>
Remember that a clear design specifications is key for a good application.
{: .notice--info}

<br/>
Now our application design is finished, it is high time we start implementing our application using `Averos Designer`. <br/>
Usually, developing such an application from scratch is considered as a long heavy process which involve environment preparation and hours of coding. <br/>
Using `Averos Designer` you will be able to build this application in minutes. <br/>

Next, we will delve deeper into `Averos Designer` and generate our application.<br/>
