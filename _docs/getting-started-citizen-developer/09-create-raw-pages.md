## **I. Introduction**

In the previous section we created the use cases related to our business entities.<br/>
We used some of the **averos generic use cases** that we have configured according to our use case requirements.<br/>
But what if you happen to know few things about `frontend` development and wanted to create your own `page` with your own layout and logic ?<br/>

Fortunately, for this case, **averos framework** provides a feature that allows `developers` to integrate with the framework.<br/>
It provides the possibility to create a `blank page` and to integrate it to its default menu.<br/>

Do you remember how in the **requirements phase**, we have defined some additional requirements ? <br/>
Well, one of these requirements exactly matches this one.<br/>


In this section we will create a `blank page` that will be accessed publicly, and add a link to it in the public default menu using `Averos Designer`.<br/>

>ðŸ”– Please note that since this part requires some advanced technical knowledge, this feature could be relevant only for developer and IT professionals who has some knowledge about software development.<br/>
So you might want to skip this part if you feel not ready to do it.<br/>

## **II. Create a Blank Page**

Get back to **Averos Designer** and go ahead and expand **`Use cases & Pages`** components list located in the **Averos Components** panel.<br/>

Drag & drop a `Blank Page` component into the canvas as follows:

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/35-new-blank-page.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/35-new-blank-page.png" alt="New Averos Blank Page">
        <figcaption>New Averos Blank Page</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

Select your new `Blank Page` component and update its properties using the `Page Properties` panel in the right side as follows:
>- **Page Name**: **`MyPublicPage`**
>- **Add a route to the page?**: check it
>- **Target Menu**: choose **`Add To Top Menu`**
>- **Target Space**: choose **`Show in Public Space`**

Click on `apply`.<br/>

Your new blank page should look like the one in the picture below:

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: center;"> 
<div style="padding: 10px;">
  <figure align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/36-my-blank-page.png">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/c-developer/36-my-blank-page.png" alt="My Blank Page">
        <figcaption>My Blank Page</figcaption>
    </a>
  </figure>
</div>
</div>

And that's all !ðŸš€ <br/>
<br/>
Easy peasy! isn't it? <br/>
<br/>

Now, you have a blank page which is available anonymously in the public space via a link in the top public menu.<br/>
May be you need a public dashboard, a brand new register page or a brand new sign in page; whatever your needs are, this page is here for you to be updated as you wish.<br/>

ðŸ’¡ After generating your application and downloading it you might open its source code in your favorite IDE and start implementing your page the way you wanted it to be.<br/><br/>
ðŸ”¥**Go create things and have fun!**ðŸ”¥

In the next section we are going to see how to bind our **application services** to their related **service backends**.<br/>
This way, our application will be ready to talk to the external world services.<br/><br/>
**See you there!**
