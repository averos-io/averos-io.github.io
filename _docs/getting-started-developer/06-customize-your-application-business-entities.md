### **I. Introduction**

We have so far defined the application business requirement as well as the target application design then generated a first version of our `ToDoApplication` with authentication and user management capabilities. <br/>
Now it is high time we implement all of those business requirements we defined earlier and create our application within minutes! <br>

In this chapter we are going to use `averos framework` to create our business entities along with their relashionship; those entities that we defined earlier in the design phase.<br/>

### **II- Generate Business Entities**

Let's step back for a moment and recall the business entities we designed earlier.<br/>
The following class diagram shows two business entities with a set of members or fields of different types.

<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/arch/tutorial/to-do-uml-diagram.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/arch/tutorial/to-do-uml-diagram.png" alt="ToDoApplication UML Diagram">
      <figcaption>ToDoApplication UML Diagram</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>

Our design is composed of **Two entities**, namely `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask`, **managed by** two services, respectively `ToDoAreaService` and `ToDoTaskSerice`.<br/>
`ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask` are related to each other since a `ToDoTask` can belong to a `ToDoArea`. <br/>

>‚ÑπÔ∏è As mentioned in the previous chapter an **averos service** should be bound to its api backend using an **averos configuration**.<br/>
Since each business entity is managed by an **averos service**, those services should be bound each to one single dedicated service configuration. <br/>
Therefore you might want to create two service configuration for `ToDoAreaService` and `ToDoTaskSerice` after generating the business entities. 


In order to generate the previous class diagram you need to follow the steps below:
  1.  generate each entity and link it to its managing service
  2.  generate entity members for each entity
  3.  generate entity relationships
  4.  generate a service configuration for each managing service


Let's generate our two business entities along with their managing service.<br/>

>‚ÑπÔ∏è **Averos commands** could be executed either in **interactive mode** or in **silent mode**.<br/>
For the sake of this tutorial, we are going to execute all commands in silent mode.<br/>
Nevertheless, it is fine to execute these commands interactively if you wish.
{: .notice--info}


>‚ÑπÔ∏è **Please make sure you execute averos workflow commands UNDER YOUR PROJECT HOME FOLDER!**
{: .notice--danger}

**Averos Framework** provides the `averos workflow` command,`averos-entity`, which will generate the target entity along with it's managing service for you.<br/>


#### **1. Generate `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask` entities**

Go ahead and execute the following commands in order to generate `ToDoArea` entity:

```bash
  ng g @wiforge/averos:averos-entity --name=ToDoArea --sname=ToDoAreaService --defaults
```

The output of the command will look like the following:

<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/7-generate-todoarea.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/7-generate-todoarea.png" alt="ToDoArea Entity Generation Command Output">
      <figcaption>ToDoArea Entity Generation Command Output</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>

Similarely, go ahead and execute the following command in order to generate `ToDoTask` entity.

```bash
  ng g @wiforge/averos:averos-entity --name=ToDoTask --sname=ToDoTaskService --defaults
```

>‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that the managing service name is defined by the command parameter `--sname`.
{: .notice--info}

The execution of these two averos workflow commands will result in the creation of:
  1. an entity called `ToDoArea` and a service called `ToDoAreaService`
  2. an entity called `ToDoArea` and a service called `ToDoAreaService`


>üîñ **Note** that `averos framework`, when calling `averos-entity`, will create by default the following entity members:
   - **id**: annotated by the averos @ID() decorator in order to tell the framework that it should handle this field as an identifier
   - **name**: a string member describing the name of the entity
   - **description**: a string member related to the entity description
   - **createdBy**: of type User (**averos User type** by default) related to the user who created the entity
   - **updatedBy**: of type User (**averos User type** by default) related to the user who updated the entity
   - **createdAt**: of type `date` related to the entity creation date
   - **updatedAt**: of type `date` related to the entity update date
{: .notice--info}

>At this point you might want to open your project using your favorite IDE so that you can carefully examine the generated code for your project.
{: .notice--warning}

>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Please refer to the [**averos service**]({{ "/averos/documentation/references-and-conventions/reference-averos-service/" | relative_url }} "Averos Service") section for further details about **averos services**.
{: .notice--info}

>üí° Further details about averos commands are available in the [**detailed averos workflow commands**]({{ "/averos/documentation/reference-detailed-averos-worflow-commands/" | relative_url }} "detailed averos workflow commands") section.
{: .notice--success}

#### **2. Generate `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask` Simple Members**

According to our design, both entities have a bunch of attributes (members) that come in different types.<br/>
At first glance you might think that those members should be generated as well.
Well, that is partially right!<br/>
Remember we mentioned earlier that `averos-entity` workflow command creates seven reserved members for every new generated entity. <br/>
Those members are, on one hand, reserved, on the other hand, automatically generated for you. So there is no need to regenerate them once again.<br/>

This means that, according to our design only one member should be generated.<br/>
This member belongs to the entity `ToDoTask` and it is called `status`.<br/>

`averos-framework`¬†provides the workflow command, **`add-simple-member`**, in order to create entity members. <br/>
When executing this command you should specify the entity to which belongs the member (aka `ename`), the member name (aka `mname`) and the member type (aka `member-type`). <br/>
When the member to be added is of type `enumeration`, in addition to the previous command parameter, you might include the enumeration values (aka list-of-enum-values). <br/>

>üö© When executed interactively, the workflow will ask you to specify the enumeration values used for this type of member. Those values should be **no-space comma separated valid javascript identifier** (`value1,value2,value3`).<br/>
Entries like `value1 ,value2, value3` or `value1 , value2 , value3` or `value1 , value2 , value3` or `value1 , value2 , value3` are not allowed.
{: .notice--danger}

Go ahead and execute the following command to generate the member named `status`.<br/>
`status` is an enumeration that has three values: `Active`, `Closed` or `New`.<br/>


```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:add-simple-member --ename=ToDoTask --mname=status --member-type=enumeration --list-of-enum-values=Active,Closed,New
```
<br/>

The command output should be similar to the output below:

<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/8-generate-simple-member-output.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/8-generate-simple-member-output.png" alt="Simple Member Generation Command Output">
      <figcaption>Simple Member Generation Command Output</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>

#### **3. Generate `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask` Relatioships - Composite Member**

According to our design, `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask` are logically related; given that one of our business requirement says that user can assign one or several `ToDoTask` to one specific `ToDoArea`.<br/>
Therefore, `ToDoArea` could contain one or more `ToDoTask`.

From a navigability perspective, a composite relationship can be either `navigable` or `mute`. When a composite relationship is `navigable` the relationship owner (parent) has knowledge of its composite child(s). <br/>
`Averos framework` defines relationship navigability within the owner entity view layout which will impact some of the use cases layout. <br/>

üì¢ More on this topic is available in the [averos detailed documentation]({{"/averos/documentation/averos-entity-workflows/" | relative_url}}).
{: .notice--info}

In our example, `ToDoArea` has knowledge of its `ToDoTask` child collection in the context of a `One To Many` relationship. <br/>
On the other hand, each `ToDoTask` child has knowledge of its `ToDoArea` parent entity.<br/>
Such a case could be seen as a two-way navigability.<br/>

In order to satisfy such requirement you omay want to: <br/>
1. Reference a `ToDoTask` collection by adding a new member of type `ToDoTask` collection to the `ToDoArea` parent entity
2. Reference the `ToDoArea` parent entity by adding a new member of type `ToDoArea` to the `ToDoTask` child entity
3. Update both `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask` view layout in order to display the navigability
4. Implement the `COMPOSITE` service APIs accordingly as described in the [Averos Service APIs Naming Conventions]({{ "/averos/getting-started-developer/reference-averos-service#averos-service-apis-naming-conventions/" | relative_url }}  "Averos Service APIs Naming Conventions") section


Handling relationships will need further complex implementations and clear design. Not to mention that one should repeat the integration process for every member describing a relationship that should be handled.
Once again, averos fortunately introduced the `add-composite-member` workflow to achieve all the steps above.


>üîñ Note that `add-composite-member` workflow will update the project in order to automatically configure and display relationships in the user interface.<br/>
Refer to the [**detailed averos workflow commands**]({{ "/averos/documentation/reference-detailed-averos-worflow-commands/" | relative_url}} "Detailed averos workflow commands")  section for further details. <br/>
{: .notice--warning}

Our **one-way navigeable relationship** is described as follows: <br/>

- `ToDoArea` has knowledge of its `ToDoTasks`. This is a `OneToMany` relationship.
    `ToDoTask` collection is also updatable from its parent entity, `ToDoArea`. This means that the user can add or remove one or several `ToDoTask` from the `ToDoTask` collection related to a given `ToDoArea` instance. Handling such requirement will result in defining a child's update strategy using the flag `--member-update-strategy`.<br/>
   
 
Now, let us go ahead and generate this relatioship (aka. composite member) by executing the ollowing workflow command:

```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:add-composite-member --ename=ToDoArea --fename=ToDoTask --field-relation-type=OneToMany --member-update-strategy=single
```
The command output should be similar to the output below:

<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/9-generate-composite-member-output.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/9-generate-composite-member-output.png" alt="Composite Member Generation Command Output">
      <figcaption>Composite Member Generation Command Output</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>


>üîñ Note that after running these two commands and deploying your application, you will be able to view the newly added relations. Further user specific business implementation could be achieved in order to customize your entity management workflow. Some of these aspects were described in the next chapter.
{: .notice--info}


#### **4. Generate `ToDoAreaService` and `ToDoTaskService` Bindings Configurations**

`ToDoAreaService` and `ToDoTaskService`are the managing services of `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask`.<br/>
These `averos services` need to be bound to their `APIs backend service` using `averos configurations`.<br/>

For the sake of this tutorial we are going to use our `backend mock server` in order to manage `ToDoArea` and `ToDoTask` entities, but you are free to implement and use your own APIs. <br/>

>Recall that our `APIs backend server` mock is running in *localhost* (`--host=localhost`), on port *3333* (`--port=3333`) through *http* protocol (`--protocol=http`). <br/>
If you have changed these parameters please use your new ones accordingly. <br/>
{: .notice--success}

Go ahead and execute the following averos command in order to create `ToDoAreaService` service binding:

```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:averos-config --id=ToDoAreaService --type=service --host=localhost --port=3333 --protocol=http --endpoint=/todoareas --defaults
```

The command output should be similar to the following one:

<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/10-generate-todoarea-service-config.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/10-generate-todoarea-service-config.png" alt="Service Configuration Generation Command Output">
      <figcaption>Service Configuration Generation Command Output</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>



Similarely, go ahead and execute the following averos command in order to create `ToDoTaskService` service binding:

```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:averos-config --id=ToDoTaskService --type=service --host=localhost --port=3333 --protocol=http --endpoint=/todotasks --defaults
```

Now our business entities has been generated along with their managing services, let's look at our application again; but before that you might want to re-build then re-deploy your application so that all changes will be applied.<br/>


#### **5. Re-Deploy your application and check it out**

Go ahead an redeploy your application by following these steps:<br/>
   >  **1.** shutdown the running server `http-server`<br/>
      **2.** build and deploy `ToDoApplication` by running the following command: <br/>  
   >
   ```bash
   ng build ToDoApplication && http-server -p 8081 -c-1 dist/to-do-application
   ```

Once **ToDoApplication** is up and running, go ahead navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) <br/>

Here is what your application looks like:

<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/11-todoapplication-entity-generated.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial/developer/11-todoapplication-entity-generated.png" alt="ToDoApplication - With generated entities">
      <figcaption>ToDoApplication - With generated entities</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Did you noticed that nothing has changed in your application since the last time you visited it; even after implementing your business entities and your service ?<br/>
Well, that is because you have not added any use case yet.<br/>
Once you will generate your use cases, you will start to notice updates on the application menu.<br/>
Depending on the use case to be added, menu links will be added to the application as you generate more and more use cases.<br/>

Well that is what we will do in the next chapter!<br/>


**üéâüéâüéâ Congratulations on making it so far! üéâüéâüéâ**<br/>
You have generated your business entities along with their managing services in no time!
In the next chapter you are going to create the use cases you defined earlier in the design phase and start playing with your entities.<br/><br/>
**Let's take your `ToDoApplication` to the next level!**
