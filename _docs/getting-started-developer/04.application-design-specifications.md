### **I. Introduction**

So far, we have defined our application purpose and described its bsuiness requirements.<br/>
As a result, the main business entities are starting to emmerge as we delve deeper and deeper into definitions and requirements. <br/>

Now it's time to define our application design.

### **II. ToDo Application Design**

If you carefully examine the Application definitions and business requirements, you will find out that those could be depicted by some entities and components. <br/>
Here are the main components that you might think of:
  - Two main entities, **ToDoArea** and **ToDoTask**
  - Four main use cases for each entity (i.e. `create/delete/search/update`) 
    - **(create/delete/search/update) ToDoArea**
    - **(create/delete/search/update) ToDoTask**
  - Two use cases that involve both **ToDoArea** and **ToDoTask** (i.e. `assign/unassign`) and which is dealing with update entity relationships:
    - **(assign/unassign)** **ToDoTask**(s) from a given **ToDoArea**

>It is assumed that you have basic knowledge on UML in order to be able to grasp what comes next. <br/>

#### **II.1- `ToDoApplication` Class Diagram**

According to our previous study, it is safe to assume that the following class diagram could genuinely describe our main entities and their relationships.

</figure>


#### **II.2- `ToDoApplication` Use Cases Diagram**

According to our previous study we have identified a couple of use cases that define how a given user can interact with `ToDoApplication`. <br/>
Those use cases might be described by the following Use case diagram.

Now our application design is finished, it is high time we start implementing our application using `averos framework`. <br/>
Usually, developing such an application from scratch is considered as a long heavy process which involve environment preparation and hours of coding. <br/>
Using `averos framework` you will be able to deliever this application in minutes. <br/>

Next, we will delve deeper into `averos framework` and build our application.
