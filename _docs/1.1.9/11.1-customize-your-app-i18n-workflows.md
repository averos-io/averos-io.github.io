Now your application is almost ready, what if you take it to the next level and let it speak multiple languages so that you can target a wider audience ?

If this sounds brilliant to you then go ahead and let your application learn a new language in 3 seconds.

**Averos** framework made specific workflows availables in order to achieve such a feat.
Let's go ahead and learn French!

#### **1- Add a new language support:**

Currently **averos** supports 11 languages out of the box.
In order to add a new language support to your application, **Averos** provides the following workflow command:

```bash
    ng g @wiforge/averos:add-language --languageCode=[language code]
```
<br/>

| **Supported Language** | **Language Code** |
| ------ | ------ | 
| Arabic     [ ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡³ ] | `ar` |
| Chinese    [ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ] | `cn` |
| English    [ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ] | `en` |
| Spanish    [ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ] | `es` |
| French     [ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ] | `fr` |
| German     [ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ] | `de` |
| Japanese   [ ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ ] | `jp` |
| Dutch      [ ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ] | `nl` |
| Norwegian  [ ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ ] | `no` |
| Russian    [ ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º ] | `ru` |
| Swedish    [ ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª ] | `se` |

<br/>
Let's learn French:

```bash
    ng g @wiforge/averos:add-language --languageCode=fr
```

By the end of the workflow execution, Your application will be able to speak french at a beginner level. It already knows all basic actions words like `create` or `search`.

Let's improve your application vocabulary and learn new French words! 

#### **2- learn new vocabulary:**

Your application can learn new word related to its object echosystem.
From components and use cases to entities and members throughout view layouts, every thing can be learnt in a new language.

In order to let your application learn a new word, **Averos** provides the following workflow command:

```bash
    ng g @wiforge/averos:add-translation-entry --key=[your Word generic id] --value=[Your word in the target language] --lang=[the target language]
```

>ðŸš© **key** is described as the most natural, canonical word designation.
   averos uses the following convention in order to identify its objects echosystem:
   - **Entity**
     - the entity name is defined by it's class name in lowercase (ToDoTask entity ==> `translationKey = todotask`)
     - entity members are defined by their names in lower case prefixed by their parent entity id (ex. ToDoTask.name ==> `translationKey = todotask.name`)
   - **use cases**: All use case `translationKeys` starts with `uc.[action]` followed by the entity name in lower case and the target position. The target position could be either ethe `title` or a `label` to show in the subtitle. `action` on the other hand can be one of the followinf values: `create`, `edit`, `view`, `delete`.
     - **search use case**: uses the following pattern: `uc.search.[entityNameInLowerCase].[title | label]` (ex. `uc.search.todotask.title`)
     - **edit use case**: uses the following pattern: `uc.edit.[entityNameInLowerCase].[title | label]` (ex. `uc.edit.todotask.label`)
     - **create use case**: uses the following pattern: `uc.create.[entityNameInLowerCase].[title | label]` (ex. `uc.create.todotask.title`)
   - **menu**:
     - **menuItem**: All menu items traslationKeys starts with `menu.` followed by the entity class name in lowercase followed by the action if any. (ex. a menuItem that leads to the creation of an entity named `ToDoTask` will have the following `translationKey`: `menu.todotask.add`). The grouping parent menu will have the following `translationKey`: `menu.todotask`.
     Thus, Menu item translation keys will follow the patter `menu.${entityNameInLowerCase}.[action]` where action is optional.

So let's teach our application how to call the `ToDoTask` entity search use case and search menu Item in French.
Go ahead an execute the following commands:

```bash 
   ng g @wiforge/averos:add-translation-entry --key=uc.search.todotask.title --value="Chercher des TÃ¢ches" --lang=fr

   ng g @wiforge/averos:add-translation-entry --key=menu.todotask.search --value="Recherche de TÃ¢che" --lang=fr
```

CONGRATULATIONS! Your application is starting to learn French!
