On a side note, but not the less important,  I noticed that a fair amount of an application use cases, with more or less complexity, usually falls into the **CRUD (Create/Update/Delete)** use case category. 
CRUD use cases could be thus seen as a general purpose use cases, that could be shaped according to a specific business requirement and fit to it to the farthest extent.

It is obvious then, that these use cases should have a set of basic user friendly intelligent controls and behaviours in order to enhance the user experience and provide a better interactions with him.
Such controls are widely used in almost every single application to the extent of being common for every use case. 

Imagine a synchronous update operation that leaves ground to the user to execute other actions while the application updates a business entity. <br/>
It is likely that the application will behave awkwardly, producing unexpected results. Not to mention the data inconsistency problem this may cause. 

Besides, how does it sound to you, if your application, while performing synchronous operations, does not deliever responses to you or does not tell you,for the least, that a synchronous operation is ongoing and that you will not be able to execute an other action untill the pending operation finishes ? <br/>
How if your application does not tell your that your request has been taken into account in the context of an asynchronous action ? Or, when filling out a form, does not provide you with the relevant information so that you can enter a correct values ? <br/>
Dealing with such applications is the worst thing a user can experience while in his digital journey. <br/>

At some point, you will need a seemless two-way communication with your application in order to experience a wonderful digital journey. <br/>
Yet, there is often a tendency to prioritise technical aspects over usability aspects; which, unfortunately, leads to a poor user experience throughout the digital, journey even with a good technical architecture. <br/>

Luckily, averos will take all of these aspects into consideration by bringing common natural and obvious end users experience to your application. <br/>
Although I have a lot more to say on this topic, I won't dwell on it too much as it could be the subject of another article.
