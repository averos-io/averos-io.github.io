**Averos framework** introduces the **AverosConfiguration** interface which is aimed to be a global context configurator for any averos application; meaning that any customization that is perfromed at the global application context level could be considered as an **Averos Configuration**.<br/>
Service-to-api bindings, authentication providers, gateway-to-service bindings, runtime parameters, you name it, all of these are configurations that are done at the global scale and are bound to be an **Averos Configuration**. <br/>


Currently **Averos Framework** provides two major implementations of **Averos Configuration** that handles business services to apis binding, namely: 
- **`ServiceConfiguration`** 
- **`GatewayConfiguration`**

If necessary, future averos version may include other **averos configuration** types such as runtime configuration, test configuration, business configuration, resource configuration and profile configuration to name a few.
