**Averos framework** introduces a generic web application component that includes all the averos modules and creates a ready to deploy application in no time.<br/>
`averos-application` is the core averos component and is considered as your main entry point, that holds all the web application logic and templates and will integrate flawlessly with any additional user custom components and configuration.<br/>

Again, executing `ng add @wiforge/averos` will configure your application at your stead.<br/>

Besides, if you are willing to manually integrate the averos main component when creating a new angular application, you will need to :
1. import  AverosCoreModule in your application main module
2. enable the AverosApplicationComponent in the application main component `app.component.html`:
    
    ```
    <averos-application>
    </averos-application>
    ```

>ðŸš© Note that, `averos-application` main component could be enhanced with additional use cases, components and services regardless of the target business. The development process remains the same as any regular angular application development process (create, include and call any component, service, entity, directive...).
