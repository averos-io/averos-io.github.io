# **1. Description**

Usually, sensative and personal data shoud not be accessible for unknown users.
Accessing such data requires the user to be authenticated via at least one trusted authentication provider. <br/>
Additional security layers such as access tokens or refresh tokens should also be considered when dealing with authentication and authorization. <br/>
A lot of authentication providers exist out of the market such as, [**Auth0**]({{"https://auth0.com/" | relative_url}} "Auth0"), [**Firebase Auth**]({{"https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth" | relative_url}} "Firebase Auth"), [**Clerk**]({{"https://clerk.com/" | relative_url}} "Clerk Authentication and user management"), [**KeyCloak**]({{"https://www.keycloak.org/" | relative_url}} "KeyCloak"), [**Amazon Cognito**]({{"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/" | relative_url}} "Amazon Cognito") to name a few. <br/>
Just like any application, averos applications could include an authentication layer that relies on an authentication provider. <br/>
The current averos framework version is built on top of **Averos auth provider** a custom authentication and authorization api that was built around **`jwt`**, **`access tokens`** and **`refresh tokens`**.

# **3. Custom Authentication Provider**
Averos

Averos application uses [jwt](https://jwt.io "JSON Web Token") as the default authentication and authorization schema. It relays on authentication providers which could be considered as authentication APIs that handle and manage
the authentication and authorization processes.
For the sake of this tutorial, we are going to use an authentication mock server that I made available in the following github [repository](https://github.com/averos-io/averos-backend-mock "Averos Backend Mock").
This authentication api mock, available for forking at will, will be used as our authentication provider. 

>ðŸš© Note that, the default authentication server is configured to run on port 3333. If the mock server is running on your local machine, then the authentication server URL parameter that should be made available to the `ng add @wiforge/averos` workflow command will be equal to `http://localhost:3333`

More details on averos authentication provider could be found in the [**Authentication Provider**]({{"/averos/getting-started/reference-authentication-provider/" | relative_url}} "Authentication Provider") section, further below.

In order to install and start the **averos backend mock** you may proceed with the following command line:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/averos-io/averos-backend-mock && cd averos-backend-mock && npm install && npm start
 ```
