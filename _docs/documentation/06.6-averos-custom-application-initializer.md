Aside from the **Global Application Initializer**, which is activated by default when importing averos core module, averos users can define their own application initializer that will be executed prior to the global application initializer.<br/>
Custom application initializers are a way to include specific user actions into your application, that are required to be available beforehand such as fetching application data from database, configuring global application parameters, preparing global configurations â€¦ect.<br/>

One particular custom application initializer, will be created by the command workflow `ng add @wiforge/averos`, and which will be in charge of registering any custom business entity into the averos framework context in order to make their entities metadata available to the framework beforehand.

A custom application initializer would look like this:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ApplicationInitializerService {

  private registeredEntities: Array<any> = 
                            [
                                Entity1.instanceMetadata(), 
                                Entity2.instanceMetadata(),
                                Entity3.instanceMetadata(),
                                Entity4.instanceMetadata(),
                                Entity5.instanceMetadata(),
                                Entity6.instanceMetadata()
                            ];

  constructor(private viewLayoutService: ViewLayoutService) {}

  initialize(): Promise<any> {
          const registerEntitiesPromise = this.viewLayoutService.registerEntitiesViewLayouts(this.registeredEntities);
          const asyncInitPromises: Promise<any>[] = [registerEntitiesPromise];
          return Promise.all(asyncInitPromises);// Wait for all promises to execute
  }
}
```
