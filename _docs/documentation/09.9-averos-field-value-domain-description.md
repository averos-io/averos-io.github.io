<br/>

As described in the previous chapter, a field value domain values defines the list of values to be displayed in a type collection component field.<br/>

For instance, a list box domain values including `{“Male”,”Female”}` will defines the possible values related to the member `gender` which belongs to the entity `User`).<br/> 
The target Field Domain could be either **static** or **dynamic**. <br/>

When using the **`static value domain`**, averos users should provide a set of values that describes the target domain by setting them in the **`defaultDomain`** attribute. <br/>

**`Dynamic values domain`**, on the other hand, will require averos users to specify a field **`domain service`** along with a **`service method`** that the framework will request in order to get the target values.<br/>
Refer to [**Domain Controller Service Specifications**]({{"/averos/documentation/averos-domain-controller-service/" | relative_url}}) for further details.
