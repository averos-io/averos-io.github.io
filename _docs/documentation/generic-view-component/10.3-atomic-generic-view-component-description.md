## 1. Description

**Atomic generic components** are the view components of which every use case view could be composed, regardless of its complexity. <br/>
These atomic components depict a simple html component whether it’s an input text, a list box, a search criteria input field, a label...etc… <br/>

**Atomic generic components** belongs to two categories:
- **Search Input Atomic Generic View Components**
- **View, Edit Atomic Generic View Components** 
- **Generic Table View Components** 

A form or a multiple search input filter, for example, could be seen as a set of atomic generic components that are shaped according to a specific display order and styling configurations. <br/>

A generic atomic component could be reused multiple times if it happen to meet the target use case requirement.
