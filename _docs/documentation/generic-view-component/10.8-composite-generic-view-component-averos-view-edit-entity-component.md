## 1. Description

**Averos View Edit Entity Component** is a generic angular component that is aimed to fit to any **`view`**, **`edit`** or **`create`** use case that is targeting a specific entity. <br/>

The component is **self-context aware** and **adapt its view UI** according to the target **use case**; meaning that it could switch from **view** to **edit** layout and vice versa with respect to the desired implementation depending on its current Use Case View Layout context.<br/>
Any time you change from one view type to another, the related view layout type will change accordingly.<br/>

**`AverosViewEditEntity`** generic component, fits well with **CRUD** use cases and could, alone, fully meet CREATE, VIEW, EDIT use cases, all in the same component.<br/>

Averos has defined a custom workflow, named **`create-entity-uc`**, that leverage this generic component and which will generate a fully functional CREATE entity use case based on a given entity.
