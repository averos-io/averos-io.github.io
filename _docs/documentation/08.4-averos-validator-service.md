## 1. Description

This service type is a regular angular service type that is decorated by the averos decorator **`@AverosValidator()`**. <br/> 
The validator service will act on the entitiesâ€™ members by providing a fully customizable values validation. <br/>

Both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** validations are supported.<br/>

Averos validation service will make it easy to implement custom field validators and provide an instant feedback to the user on the validation progress.<br/>

Validators are manually implemented like any regular angular services.
Averos users are kept free to name their Validator services along with their validation methods.


## 2. Validator Service Class Diagram

Below is the Averos **Validator Service** class diagram related to a custom validator service.

Below is a typescript implementation of a Validator service named **`CustomFieldValidatorService`**:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
@AverosValidator()
export class CustomFieldValidatorService {
}
```

>ðŸš© Field Validators should be decorated with **`@AverosValidator()`** so that the framework would enable member binding and member metadata initialization.

### 3. Synchronous Validation

Synchronous validations are validations that occurs in a synchronous way, without requesting other resources, services or asynchronous logics.<br/>
Validating charactersâ€™ pattern against a regular expression is one typical synchronous validation.<br/>

### 4. Asynchronous Validation

Asynchronous validations are validations that occurs in an asynchronous way; by either requesting remote resources, services or asynchronous logic. <br/>
The validation process execution will then depend on asynchronous actions and thus it will wait for all asynchronous responses in order to complete its execution.<br/> 

The asynchronous validation service will automatically trigger a user notification while the validation is occurring, by showing either a progress bar or a spinner, in order to prevent the user from performing extra actions while the asynchronous validation process is ongoing.<br/>

Averos provide two user notification types while performing **asynchronous validations**: 
- **A global application notification**: this will disable the whole application while performing the asynchronous validation action by showing either a progress bar or a spinner.
- **A component inlined notification:** this will only disable the entity field on which the asynchronous validation is happening by showing a progress spinner.

A typical use case of asynchronous validation would be to check whether a user name is already created while providing a new name in a create user use case.
