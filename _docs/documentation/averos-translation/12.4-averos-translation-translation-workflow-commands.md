## 1. Description

In order to automate the translation process, **averos** has introduced two workflow commands that target a specific translation area:
- Adding a new locale support
- Adding a new translation key

## 2. `add-language` Workflow Command

**Averos** supports [11 languages]({{"/averos/documentation/averos-translation/description/" | relative_url}} "supported languages") out of the box, each could be activated by running the `add-language` workflow.

```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:add-language
```

The workflow will guide through all needed steps in order to add a new language support. 

## 3. `add-translation-entry` Workflow Command

Once a language support is added to the application, averos users will need to update their translation IDs by adding new **`translation values`** to their application. <br/>
`add-translation-entry` workflow allows to add a specific translation key by running the command below:

```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:add-translation-entry
```
