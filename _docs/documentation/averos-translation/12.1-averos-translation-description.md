## Description

In order to prepare your application to be usable in different locales around the world, **Averos framework** comes with an **internationalization(i18n)** and **localization** module, named **`AverosTranslationModule`**, that is already supporting **11** languages out of the box and can include any other language just by executing **averos translation workflows** for additional languages support.<br/>

Below are the list of the languages that averos supports out of the box along with their codes: <br/>

| **Supported Language** | **Language Code** |
| ------ | ------ | 
| Arabic     [ ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡³ ] | `ar` |
| Chinese    [ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ] | `cn` |
| English    [ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ] | `en` |
| Spanish    [ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ] | `es` |
| French     [ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ] | `fr` |
| German     [ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ] | `de` |
| Japanese   [ ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ ] | `jp` |
| Dutch      [ ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ] | `nl` |
| Norwegian  [ ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ ] | `no` |
| Russian    [ ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º ] | `ru` |
| Swedish    [ ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª ] | `se` |

>ðŸš© Since **Averos translation module** is built on top of **`@angular/localize`** module, it leverage all the capabilities that are offered by the latter and obviously extends them.

>ðŸš© **ProTip** : Whenever you see **`translationID`**, you could be sure that this identifier refers to a locale ID.
{: .notice--success}

Except content data, everything that is related to the application- including all angular components- is subject to translation.<br/>

Here is what could be subject to translation translatable with **averos Translation**:
  - menus
  - labels (ex. forms, fields, actions)
  - input placeholder (input field, form)
  - validation messages
  - fixed sets of values: enumerations (ex. list items)
  - dynamic set of values: value domains (ex.list items)
  - notification messages (ex. alerts, dialog messages)
  - tooltips
  
>ðŸš© **Note** that when you import **`AverosCoreModule`** you are by default using **Averos Transmation Module**.<br/>
However, if you only wish to integrate this module and leverage its i18n capabilities within any angular application you should import it into your main application module.
