## 1. Description

This service type is a regular angular service type that should implements a set of methods that are needed by the framework in order to enable advanced crud operations such as updating an entity or deleting a composite OneToMany relationship, as well as business logics. <br/>
This service type is mainly used for managing an entity as a business object.<br/>

Managing averos entities involves **`updating`**, **`deleting`**, **`creating`**, **`searching`**, or **`performing custom business actions`** on the managed entity and on its children in the context of their relationship types.

## 2. Workflow Command: averos-service

### Description

Adding an averos business service could be achieved either **manually** or by means of the dedicated workflow command **`averos-service`**.

>🚩 We recommend using “averos-service” command while creating business services so that the required guidelines aspects, including all required service methods, could be automatically met.
{: .notice--info}

### Command Usage

Below is the full detailed workflow command line:
```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:averos-service --name=MyEntityService --ename=MyEntityName
```

### Input Parameters
- **name**:  **Mandatory parameter**. Defines the name of the service to create
- **ename**: **Mandatory** parameter. Defines the name of the entity managed by the newly created service. This entity should be created beforehand using the command `ng g @wiforge/averos:averos-entity`. Refer to [**averos entity**]({{"/averos/documentation/averos-entity-workflows/" | relative_url}} "averos-entity") section for further details.

### Output

The command will result in the creation of an angular service along with all the required business methods described above.<br/>

Below is a typical typescript implementation of an averos business service called **`MyEntityService`** that is managing an entity called **`MyEntity`**:


```typescript
export class MyEntityService {

  public myEntityAPIUrl = 'http://server:port/api/myentities';
 
    updateEntity(id: any, entityTopdate: any | Partial<any>): Observable<any> {}
   
    createEntity(value: any): Observable<any> {}
 
    deleteEntity(id: any): Observable<any> {}
 
    getAllEntities(): Observable<ToDoTask[]> {}
 
    getEntityById(id: string): Observable<any> {}
 
    getEntitiesByIds(ids: string[]): Observable<any> {}
 
    getEntitiesByCriteria(criteria: SearchInputCriteria): Observable<any>{}
 
    deleteRelationCollection(parentId: any, relationName: string, cids: {id: string}[]): Observable<any> {}
 
    addRelationCollection(parentId: any, relationName: string, cids: {id: string}[]): Observable<any> {}
   
 }
```


>🚩 When manually implementing an averos service, user should keep the default methods name and signature in order to stay in line with the framework specification and not to break the framework capabilities.
