The **averos Core module** is the main averos framework component that acts as a root module that should be imported within application in order to leverage all the averos framework benefits and capabilities.<br/>

Importing the core module will activate all the framework capabilities including:
- averos application, 
- averos view, 
- generic customizable menu, 
- generic use cases view, 
- form generation, 
- customizable validators, 
- pre-built views, 
- averos translation, 
- application optimizations 
- and much more.<br/>

Averos core module comes with a set of bootstrap configurations that are meant to define specific environment values when running the application. <br/>
All core module configurations are held in the **`AverosConfig`** entity and mainly includes the _**back end URL**_ and the list of _**supported languages**_.<br/>
_**Back end URL**_ configuration defines any back end service api that is meant to be used for any HTTP REST call routines made by the front end application to which ever back end complying with the implemented business logic.<br/>
_**Supported languages**_ configuration, on the other hand, will bootstrup the target supported languages list into the application by providing further configurations in order to fully support those languages.<br/>

You may also execute the following command in order to initialize a new web application and include all the featues above:

```bash
ng add @wiforge/averos
```


>ðŸš© Note that, the averos workflow  `ng add @wiforge/averos` is considered as your starting point and will include the averos core module into your application, automatically activating all the averos aspects mentioned above.
