The **averos Core module** is the main averos framework component that acts as a root module which should be imported in order to leverage all the averos framework benefits and capabilities.<br/>

Importing the core module will activate all the framework capabilities including:
- averos application, 
- averos view, 
- generic customizable menu, 
- generic use cases view, 
- form generation, 
- customizable validators, 
- pre-built views, 
- averos translation, 
- application optimizations 
- and much more.<br/>

Averos core module comes with a set of bootstrap configurations that are meant to define specific environment values when running the application. <br/>
All core module configurations are held in the **`FrameworkConfiguration`** interface and mainly includes the list of _**supported languages**_.<br/>
_**Supported languages**_ configuration, on the other hand, will bootstrup the target supported languages list into the application by providing further configurations in order to fully support those languages.<br/>

You may also execute the following command in order to initialize a new web application and include all the featues above:

```bash
ng add @wiforge/averos
```


>ðŸš© Note that, the averos workflow  `ng add @wiforge/averos` is considered as your starting point and will include the averos core module into your application, automatically activating all the averos aspects mentioned above.
