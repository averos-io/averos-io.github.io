## 1. Description


**Averos Create Page** is a composite use case that is meant to create a new **empty averos page** along with a route and a default menu entry.<br/> 

**Averos** introduces a workflow command, named **`create-page`** , that automates such use case creation.
The command will create an empty angular component, assign a new route to it and updated the user menu entry with the new component.<br/>

Depending on the workflow command parameters, the new **raw page** will either be available in `public` space or in `logged`.<br/>
The menu link could be added to the `side` menu, the `top` menu or to `both`.<br/>

This use case comes to help averos users, mainly developers, to rapidly create, configure and integrate new components with averos framework.<br/>

The generated component is fully angular compliant and could thus be enhanced at will.<br/>


## 2. **`create-page`** Command Usage

```bash
ng g @wiforge/averos:create-page
```
