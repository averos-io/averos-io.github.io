<br/>

A **`GroupedFieldViewLayout`** is a logical set of **`FieldViewLayout`**, ordered in the same view space and displayed as a single group according to a specific group **`layout`**. <br/>

A group of fields may have a **`label`** or may not. <br/>
In case a group has a **`label`**, all related fields are gathered under the same label.<br/> 
Otherwise, no group label is displayed and the belonging fields are displayed one by one in the order they were defined into.
