Averos framework introduces a brilliant way when dealing with generic components layout, by introducing a fully customizable **entity metadata**, namely **`EntityViewLayout`** that helps exposing specific entity related components layouts for modifications without the need to modify your source code.<br/>

**`EntityViewLayout`** defines the entity custom view layout and behavior when included in a specific view use case.<br/>

**`EntityViewLayout`** is composed of the following seven main use cases which have the type **`UseCaseViewLayout`**:

- **defautUCViewLayout**
- **searchInputUCViewLayout**
- **tableUCViewLayout**
- **selectableInputTableUCViewLayout**
- **createUCViewLayout**
- **viewUCViewLayout**
- **editUCViewLayout**


The seven main generic use cases are not exhaustive and could be enhanced by other specific use cases if needed.
