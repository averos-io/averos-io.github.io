<br/>

**Averos entities** hold metadata that are mandatory and required in order to bootstrap the framework context.<br/> 
Each Averos business entity should define the following metadata:
-	a simple string name: describing the name of the entity class
-	a View Layout holder: that hold the entity view layout with respect to different use cases 
-	a Service Controller: that will manage the entity (ex. CRUD operations). This service controller should be defined in the decorator **@AverosEntity()**.
-	a unique identifier:  that is decorated by **@ID()** 
-	all relationships: members defining relationships and decorated with one of the relationship decorators **@OneToOne**, **@OneToMany** and **@ManyToOne**
