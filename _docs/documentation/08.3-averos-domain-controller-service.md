## 1. Description

**`Domain Controller Service`** type is a regular angular service that is **decorated** by the averos decorator **`@DomainController`**.<br/> 

The **domain controller** will act on the entitiesâ€™ **members** by providing a fully customizable **field values domain** according to a **search values criteria**.<br/>

The domain controller will make it easy to implement entity modification use cases by providing a **set of values** that belongs to a **target value domain** based on a set of **user criteria**.<br/>

Letâ€™s say a user would like to define a set of possible values for a specific entity member field while in the entity creation use case.<br/>

One of the option is to hard code a set of predefined values related to that field.<br/>
The other option, which turns out to be more suitable for **dynamic values content**, is to define a domain service and provide a service method responsible for fetching a set of apropriate target field values based on some custom criteria.
This will allow new values, that satisfy the custom input criteria, to be included in the field domain.<br/>

A list box showing only cities names related to a specific country, given as an input criteria, could be a typical use case into which a domain controller service bound to a field named **`city`** will be in charge of retrieving all possible cities' values according to a given country identifier criteria. <br/>

Domain Controllers are manually implemented like any regular angular service.
Averos users are kept free to name their Domain controller services along with their service methods.

Below is a typescript implementation of a Domain Controller service named **`CustomFieldDomainControllerService`**:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
@DomainController()
export class CustomFieldDomainControllerService {
}
```
>ðŸš© Field Domain Controller should be decorated with **`@DomainController()`** so that the framework would enable member domain binding and member domain metadata initialization.
