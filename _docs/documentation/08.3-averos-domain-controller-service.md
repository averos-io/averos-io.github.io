## 1. Description

**`Domain Controller Service`** type is a regular angular service that is **decorated** by the averos decorator **`@DomainController`**.<br/> 

The **domain controller** will act on the entities‚Äô **members** by providing a fully customizable **field values domain** according to a **search values criteria**.<br/>

The domain controller will make it easy to implement entity Creation and Update use cases by providing a **set of values** that belongs to a **specific domain** based on a set of **user criteria**.<br/>

Let‚Äôs say a user would like to define a set of possible values for a specific entity member field.<br/> 

One of the option is to hard code a set of predefined **static values** related to that field.<br/>
The other option, which turns out to be more suitable for **dynamic values content**, is to define a domain service and provide a service method responsible for fetching a set of apropriate target field values based on some custom criteria.<br/> 
This will allow new values, that satisfy the custom input criteria, to be included in the field domain.<br/>

**Averos domain controller** supports either **static** or **dynamic** member domain data retrieval option, depending on the use case. <br/>

A list box showing only cities names related to a specific country, given as an input criteria, could be a typical use case into which a domain controller service bound to a field named **`city`** will be in charge of retrieving all possible cities' values according to a given country identifier criteria. <br/>

An other example would be to retrieve data based on a relationship between two components.<br/> 
Imagine a form with two input components, namely `Entity` and `Entity Member`.<br/>
As a first step, the user selects one entity from the list of available entities in the first input component named `Entity`. When the user selects the second component named `Entity Member` he should only see the list of members related to the entity that he selected in the first step. <br/>
The aim in this case is to dynamically retrieve related domain data (the list of entity members in this case) based on dynamic informations (a given updatable entity).<br/>
Likewise, any new entity member will be retrieved dynamically.<br/>

Below is a representation that depicts the example above. <br/>
Given a form that is composed of two `combobox` input elements named `Target Entity` - displays a list of entities- and `Locale Identifier` (displays a list of entity members). <br/> 
When one entity is selected in the first `combobox` component `Target Entity`, the second `combobox` component `Locale Identifier` shoud dynamically display the list of members that belongs to that specific entity. (Excerpt from `Translation Entry Creation` in `Averos Designer`) <br/>


In the first picture, when `EntityA` is selected in the first component, the second component `Locale Identifier` brings dynamically `EntityA` members, namely, `memberA1` and `memberA2`.

      <figcaption>Averos domain controller in action: EntityA members are brought dynamically</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>
</div>

The second picture, shows how when `EntityB` is selected, the `combobox` component `Locale Identifier` dynamically updates its data and, this time, brings `EntityB` members, namely, `memberB1`, `memberB2`, `memberB3`, `memberB4` and `memberB5`.

<div align="center">
<figure style="justify-content: center;">

      <figcaption>Averos domain controller in action: EntityB members are brought dynamically</figcaption>
  </a>
</figure>
</div>

Dynamic domain controller data retrival could also be achieved via a call to an api. <br/>

When member values belong to a specific business domain, it's usually more convenient and way user friendly to display the value text in the appropriate user language. <br/>
In this case a `translationID` record should be created accordingly for each domain value.<br/>

Currently, there is no **no-code workflow** for creating averos domain Controllers. Those are manually implemented like any regular angular service.<br/>
Note that a no-code workflow for `DomainController` will be available in next version releases.<br/>
Averos users are kept free to name their Domain controller services along with their service methods.<br/>


>üö© Domain controller service method should return an `Observable` that holds a list of `DomainEntry`.

## 2. Domain Controller Service Class Diagram

Below is the Averos **Domain Controller Service** class diagram related to a custom domain controller service.

Below is a typescript implementation of a Domain Controller service named **`CustomFieldDomainControllerService`**:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
@DomainController()
export class CustomFieldDomainControllerService {
   getFieldDomain():Observable<DomainEntry[]> {} 
}
```
>üö© Field Domain Controller should be decorated with **`@DomainController()`** so that the framework would enable member domain binding and member domain metadata initialization.
