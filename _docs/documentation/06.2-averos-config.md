While working with **averos**, additional application context parameters could be included depending on the business implementation logic. Those context parameters are depicted by the interface **FrameworkConfiguration**. All custom additional context parameters should imlement this interface.<br/>
This core module customization capability opens the door to extreme resiliency and modularity when working with averos framework. <br/>

**AverosConfig** is one implementation of **FrameworkConfiguration** that declares a list of supported languages. This list could be updated either manually or using the averos translation workflows `ng g @wiforge/averos:add-language`. <br/>


The list of environments variables is not fully exhaustive and could be updated as needed. 

```typescript
export class AverosConfig implements FrameworkConfiguration {
                  
        supportedLanguages?: string[];
}
```

-   _**supportedLanguages**_: refers to the list of supported languages. This list could be updated as needed using the available averos translation workflow.
