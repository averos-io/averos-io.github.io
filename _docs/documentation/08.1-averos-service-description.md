**Averos service** is an angular service that is intended to manage and control a given averos entity in an averos application.
Averos service will allow to handle the entity state and business logic, manage its members domains or control its members through entity validation rules.

Thus, there are three types of averos service. Each type controls a specific domain:

- **`Business service`**
- **`Field Domain Controller Service`**
- **`Validator Service`**
