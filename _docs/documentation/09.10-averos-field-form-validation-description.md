<br/>

When an entity member (aka-field) is subject to validation(s), a **FieldValidator** instance should be attached to it with all the validation description needed to accurately perform the required value control. <br/>

An entity field may have one or several validators, either **predefined**, such as angular default validators, or **customized** such as [**user predefined validators**]({{"/averos/documentation/averos-validator-service/" | relative_url}}).<br/>
The view layout of a field whose subject to custom validations should be aware of its validator- aka ‚ÄúAveros Validator‚Äù as well its validating method. <br/>

>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Please refer to [**Averos Validator Service section**]({{"/averos/documentation/averos-validator-service/" | relative_url}}) for further details about how to create a user predefined validator.
