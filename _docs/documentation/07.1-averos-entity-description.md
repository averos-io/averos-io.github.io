<br/>

**Averos entities** are simple plain classes entities that, in addition to typescript/javascript compliancy; should follow the averos entity conventions while being created.<br/>
an Averos entity should be managed by an averos service that will unlock further business operations on these managed entities.<br/>
Each averos entity has a unique dedicated service that is created either separately, using the averos workflow `service-entity` or automatically generated when creating an averos entity using `averos-entity` workflow.<br/>

Though an averos entity can be created manually, just like any plain typescript class; we recommend to use the averos workflow `ng g @wiforge/averos:averos-entity` in order to automatically generate a full averos compliant business entity along with its metadata and service handler.

Please refer to the [averos service]({{"/averos/documentation/averos-service-description/" | relative_url}}) section for further details about how averos services specifications.
