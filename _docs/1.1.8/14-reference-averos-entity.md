## **Averos Entity**


Averos entities are simple plain class entities that, in addition to typescript/javascript compliancy, should follow the averos conventions while being inserted. <br/>
Averos conventions are: <br/>
- [X] Identify your entity identifier member and decorate it with the averos **@ID()** decorator
- [X] **One to one** relationship should be annotated/decorated with **@OneToOne()** decorator
- [X] **Many to one** relationship should be annotated/decorated with the **@ManyToOne()** decorator
- [X] **One to many** relationship should be annotated/decorated with the **@OneToMany()** decorator



ðŸ“¢ More on this topic will be available soon in the ongoing averos documentation.
