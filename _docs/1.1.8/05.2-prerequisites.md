## **II. Prerequisites**

`@wiforge/averos` is an npm package, so `nodejs` will be required in order to use the library.

 Install `angular/cli` by executing the following command:

#### **3. Authentication Provider**

Averos application uses [jwt](https://jwt.io "JSON Web Token") as the default authentication and authorization schema. It relays on authentication providers which could be considered as authentication APIs that handle and manage
the authentication and authorization process.
For the sake of this tutorial, an authentication mock server could be found on the following github [repo](https://github.com/averos-io/averos-backend-mock | relative_url"Averos Backend Mock").
This authentication api mock, available for forking at will, will be used as our authentication provider. 

>ðŸš© Note that, in this case, the default authentication server running port is 3333. The auth server URL, if running on a local machine, whould match the following url: `http://localhost:3333`
