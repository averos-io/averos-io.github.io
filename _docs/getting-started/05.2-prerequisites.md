## **II. Prerequisites**

#### **1. Nodejs**
   
`@wiforge/averos` is an npm package, so `nodejs` will be required in order to use the library.
Please follow the installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/ "Nodejs") for further details about setting up **nodejs**.


#### **2. Angular cli**

 `@angular/cli` is required in order to run `averos workflows`.

 Install `angular/cli` by executing the following command:

 ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
 ```

 >**ðŸš© Note:**please refer to [**angular version compatibility**]({{"/averos/docs/latest-version/#angular-compatibility" | relative_url}} "angular version compatibility") section, for further angular versions compatibility information support.

#### **3. Authentication Provider**

Averos application uses [jwt](https://jwt.io "JSON Web Token") as the default authentication and authorization schema. It relays on authentication providers which could be considered as authentication APIs that handle and manage
the authentication and authorization processes.
For the sake of this tutorial, we are going to use an authentication mock server that I made available in the following github [github repository](https://github.com/averos-io/averos-backend-mock "Averos Backend Mock").
This authentication api mock, available for forking at will, will be used as our authentication provider. 

>ðŸš© Note that, the default authentication server is configured to run on port 3333. If the mock server is running on your local machine, then the authentication server URL parameter that should be made available to the `ng add @wiforge/averos` workflow command will be equal to `http://localhost:3333`

More details on averos authentication provider could be found in the [**Authentication Provider**]({{"/averos/docs/reference-authentication-provider/" | relative_url}} "Authentication Provider") section, further below.
{: .notice--warning}

In order to install and start the **averos backend mock** you may proceed with the following command line:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/averos-io/averos-backend-mock && cd averos-backend-mock && npm install && npm start
 ```
